/*
Take three numbers from user, i.e. n1, n2 and n3.
Now your target is Print the output in following ways:
In first line : print 'Number 1 is â€¢ then n1
In second line : print "Number 2 is " then n2
In third line : print "Number 3 is " then n3
In fourth line : print "(n1 > n2) condition is " then print boolean result of (n1 > n2).
In fifth line : print "(n2 <= n3) condition is " then print boolean result of (n2 <= n3).
In sixth line : print '(n1 < n2) || ((n2 == n3) && (n1 < n3)) condition is " then print boolean
result of (n1 < n2) || ((n2 == n3) && (n1 < n3)).
