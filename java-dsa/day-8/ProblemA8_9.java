/*
Write a program that asks the user to input a number N. If N is between 10 and 20, your
program should ask the user to enter another number M and then:-
Print the sum of the two numbers.
â€¢
If the sum is greater than equal to 100, your program should also print "That is a
large sum!" on a new line.
If N is not between 10 and 20, your program should print -1.
